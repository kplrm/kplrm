# 👋 About me
👨‍🎓 Hi, I am a **Data Scientist** with a **M.Sc. in Computer Science** from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

👨‍💻 I bring business soft skills combined with deep technical knowledge. I am specialized in **Predictive Maintenance** and **AI Consultant**. Some of the techniques that I used professionally are semi-supervised learning, autoencoders combined with Bi-LSTM, explainable AI, and ARIMA time-series forecasting.

✈️ I love travelling to see our planet's amazing nature, and learning other cultures and ways of thinking.
